Recursive adaptive integrator
-----------------------------
The recursive adaptive integrator uses the trapezium rules and estimates local errors using embedded lower order rectangular rules. To test the numerical integration routine, the following definite integrals are calculated with absolute error delta = 0.001 and relative error eps = 0.001. Errors are calculated as the difference between the numerical integration routine result and the analytical result.

Definite integral of sqrt(x) from 0 to 1:
Numerical routine result:       0.666953909054655
Analytical result:              2/3
Error:                          0.000287242387988385
Integration counts:             7

Definite integral of 4*sqrt(1-x*x) from 0 to 1:
