Eigenvalue problems:
- Must do third order polynomial curve fitting for amount of operations of Jacobi diagonalization routine in exercise B
- The eigenvalue-by-eigenvalue routine for lowest eigenvalue only works better than cyclic sweeps method for high matrix dimensions

Interpolation:
- must compare to standard library cubic spline routine
Eigenvalues:
- must calculate largest eigenvalue
