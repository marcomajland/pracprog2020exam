Bound states of hydrogen atom with shooting method for boundary value problems
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The ground state of the hydrogen atom is calculated using the shooting method for boundary value problems.
Root finder results of auxiliary function:
M(eps)=0:
Initial eps:                  -0.5
Root eps:                     NaN
Error:                        NaN
