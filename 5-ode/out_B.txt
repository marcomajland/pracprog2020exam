The SIR model
-------------
The SIR model of the covid-19 epidemic development of Denmark is solved numerically for the following initial value conditions:
Population (N): 5.8 million
Average recovery time (T_r): 7 days

As can be seen in figure SIRPlot.svg, the average contact time (T_c) is varied throughout the figure to investigate the effect of social distancing. Clearly, the effect of larger T_c yields a more flat green curve.
