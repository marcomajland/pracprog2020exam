Notes:
- ODE routine must be revised to account for integration around integration end point
- In the roots problems, the ODE routine used to calculate roots of auxiliary function of radial Schrodinger equation must be one's own ODE routine rather than Dmitri's routine (perhaps a bug in the ODE routine)
- The root finder is very sensitive to initial guess of root, perhaps a bug in the ODE routine
