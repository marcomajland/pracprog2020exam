Notes:
- ODE routine must be revised to account for integration around integration end point
- In the roots problems, the ODE routine used to calculate roots of auxiliary function of radial Schrodinger equation must be one's own ODE routine rather than Dmitri's routine (perhaps a bug in the ODE routine)
- The root finder is very sensitive to initial guess of root, perhaps a bug in the ODE routine
- In matlib, qnewton.cs routine has an extra method called sr1() which must be revised or removed (possibly a method used from Dmitri's matlib
- Must finish exercise 8C with outfile and comparison to other minimization routines
- Changed random real symmetrix matrix generator to contain double entries rather than integer entries, must check if this changes the results of any of the exercises


Eigenvalue problems:
- Must do third order polynomial curve fitting for amount of operations of Jacobi diagonalization routine in exercise B
- The eigenvalue-by-eigenvalue routine for lowest eigenvalue only works better than cyclic sweeps method for high matrix dimensions

Minimization problems:
-In exercise 8C, the minimization of the Rosenbrock function seems to require fewer minimization steps for the quasi-Newton method where the downhill simplex method requires more steps at the cost of a higher accuracy.

Exam problems:
- The initial eigenvector guess in the inverse iteration method has been replaced with a random vector rather than the Jacobi eigenvector


Interpolation:
- must compare to standard library cubic spline routine
